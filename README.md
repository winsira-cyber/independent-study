This is a tutorial for visualization of TCGA data  using available R packages such as:
1- heatmaps
2- corrplots
3- network plots

The TCGA_eset dataset is part of the curatedOvarianData package in R. It contains gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, specifically for ovarian cancer samples. This dataset includes 578 samples, with both tumor and normal (healthy) tissue samples, and contains expression data for 13,104 genes.
